## Welcome everyone!

My name is Chen Yumo. 
I am an IBI1 student at ZJU-UoE institute, Zhejiang University.

I am an out-going girl with many hobbies. I like dancing and 
playing basketball, and my favorite snack is chocolate biscuit.

I am studying Biomedical Informatics in a basic level, and it is my first 
attempt to make a website myself with GitHub pages.
